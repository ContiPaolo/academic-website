I am a PhD student in scientific machine learning at Polytechnic University of Milan. I am fascinated by the immense world that arises from blending core numerical methods with artificial intelligence learning techniques, which is what I am focusing on in my research activities. Lifelong learning is my attitude, and working day-by-day for long-term goals is my methodology.
