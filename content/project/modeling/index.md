The increasing capacity to collect data has led to the enormous success of data-driven approaches,
which are characterized by extreme flexibility, generality and non intrusive nature. At the same time,
the need of a representative dynamical model of the physical system that generated the data is of
paramount importance for providing interpretation to the data, for predicting future states, and, as an
ultimate goal, for controlling the physical system itself. In this work we present several techniques
for effectively constructing dynamical models directly from measurements.
